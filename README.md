# Oscillating-Mass-and-Dimensionality-Reduction
Code and datasets for my 3rd year mechanical engineering project, Oscillating Mass and Dimensionality Reduction.

All the datasets except for the ruler case can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SQ77P5t5RUWCSucmk4jPFbufFMX8VrJG 
or here under datasets: https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/KutzBook/KutzBook.html

The code was mostly written in MATLAB 2021b and thus it is recommended to run it in that version or newer.

When running the code, change the importCamData function (importCamVideo for Ruler_case_code) to include the filepath of the dataset.
