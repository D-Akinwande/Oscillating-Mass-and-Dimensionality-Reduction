# Oscillating-Mass-and-Dimensionality-Reduction
Code and datasets for my 3rd year mechanical engineering project, Oscillating Mass and Dimensionality Reduction.

The code was mostly written in MATLAB 2021b and thus it is recommended to run it in that version or older.

When running the code, change the importCamData function (importCamVideo for Ruler_case_code) to include the filepath of the dataset.
